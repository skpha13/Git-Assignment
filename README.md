# Collaborative GitHub Workflow Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a collaborative workflow using GitHub, where team members work together on a shared repository. The steps include setting up the repository, developing features in separate branches, creating and reviewing pull requests, merging branches, creating conflicts, and resolving them.

## Repository Setup

1. One team member creates a new repository on GitHub and adds the other as a collaborator.
2. Clone the repository locally and create a `README.md` file with basic project information.
3. Commit and push the `README.md` to the main branch.

## Branch Creation and Feature Development

1. Each team member creates a new branch from the main branch:
   - Member A: Create a branch named `feature-A`.
   - Member B: Create a branch named `feature-B`.

2. On your respective branches, add a new file:
   - Member A: Add `feature-A.txt` with relevant content.
   - Member B: Add `feature-B.txt` with relevant content.

3. Commit and push your changes to your branch.

## Creating and Reviewing Pull Requests

1. Each member creates a pull request (PR) to merge their feature branch into the main branch.
2. Review each otherâ€™s PRs, provide feedback, and suggest changes if necessary (1 comment per PR should be enough).
3. Approve and complete the PR after the review process.

## Merging Pull Requests

1. After PR approval, merge your feature branch into the main branch.
2. Ensure that both `feature-A.txt` and `feature-B.txt` files are present in the main branch after merging.

## Creating a Conflict

1. Both team members edit a file named `shared.txt` on their respective branches, making changes that will conflict with each other.
2. Commit and push your changes, then create a pull request to merge your `shared.txt` changes into the main branch.

## Resolving Conflicts

1. Work together to resolve the conflict in `shared.txt`.
2. Decide how to merge the conflicting changes, update the file accordingly, and complete the merge.
